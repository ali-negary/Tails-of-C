# Gaussian Elimination
This code was a solution to Advanced Computer Architecture programming homework.
The question is within the C files. However, to make it easy: I needed to turn the simple implementation of Gaussian Elimination code to a simple multi-thread algorithm.
To do so, I benefited from PosixThread library.
Code is not omptimized and works with the least of improvments.
